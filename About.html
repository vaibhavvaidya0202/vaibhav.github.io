        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h5>School Student & <span>Free time HTML Learner</span></h5>
          <p>Hello there! My name is Vaibhav Vaidya and I'm a school student who is currently learning HTML and CSS. I've always been fascinated by the world of web development and the endless possibilities it offers.</p>
          <P>&nbsp</P>
          <p> Learning these skills has been both challenging and rewarding for me. I've spent countless hours practicing and experimenting with different codes and designs, and I'm constantly amazed by how much there is to learn. But the more I delve into this world, the more I'm driven to improve my skills and create amazing websites that are both functional and visually appealing.</p>
          <p> &nbsp </p>
          <p> As a student, I understand the importance of time management and balance, and I strive to maintain a healthy balance between my academic pursuits and my passion for web development. I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead, and I'm committed to honing my skills and exploring all that this field has to offer.</p>
